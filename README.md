## Getting Started

A java class that converts infix arithmetic expressions to postfix and calculates
their resulting value, using a Stack ADT implemented with a resizeable array.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the source folder
- `lib`: the dependency folder

compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
